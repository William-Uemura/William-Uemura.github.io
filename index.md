# My Programming Profile

My name is William Uemura. I'm a high schooler with an intense love for programming who builds projects all the time. Below is an accessible list of most of the projects that I've worked on.

The idea for this profile page was basically ripped off from [this site](https://pfg.pw).


## My projects:

### [PassPal](https://passpal.williamuemura.repl.co/)

A very rudementary password generator and the first real website I've ever developed.


### [PassPal 2](https://passpal2.williamuemura.repl.co/)

A much prettier version of PassPal. Currently working towards


### [MealMan](https://discord.com/invite/gKWxmh8xmV)

A discord bot that can generate random recipes from a limited database and evaluate the nutrition facts of a list of ingredients. The above link directs you to the support server for the bot.


### [My Replit Django Template](https://django.williamuemura.repl.co/)

An extension of the Django framework template offered by [Replit](https://replit.com) that includes a convenient location for css/js files and a prebuilt implementation of Django's page style inheritance.
