# My Programming Profile

My name is William Uemura. I'm a high schooler who frequently writes one-off programs as a hobby. I'm also currently working on a very large project which will be posted here fairly soon.

The idea for this profile page was basically ripped off from [this site](https://pfg.pw).




## In Development:

The below projects are ones I'm working on right now. For bug reports and suggestions, please contact me at *williamfuemura@gmail.com* and I'll get in touch with you right away.



### [PassPal 2](https://passpal2.williamuemura.repl.co/)

A much prettier version of PassPal. 



### [MealMan](https://discord.com/invite/gKWxmh8xmV)

A discord bot that generates random recipes and tells you the nutrition facts of certain foods.

The above link redirects you to the support server for the bot. You cannot invite it to your server yet.



### [My Replit Django Template](https://django.williamuemura.repl.co/)

An extension of the Django framework template offered by [Replit](https://replit.com) that includes a convenient location for css/js files and a prebuilt implementation of Django's page style inheritance.




## Completed Projects:

These projects are no longer supported, but some of them may work. If you ever want me to update one of these projects, then send me a message and I'll see what I can do.



### [The World of Kaythan](https://replit.com/@PXY/WoK-Main#extraData.py)

A survival game that runs in the Python terminal.

The environment, including terrain, plants and animals, is randomly generated with every playthrough.



### [PassPal](https://passpal.williamuemura.repl.co/)

A very rudementary password generator. 



### [MyProfilePal](https://discord.com/invite/gKWxmh8xmV](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=585645133966606336&permissions=8&scope=bot)

A discord bot that lets you create custom profiles within a server, much akin to the "bio" section of other social media apps.

Discord has since turned the functions of this bot into an actual feature. MyProfilePal still has a few advantages over Discord's app, though.
