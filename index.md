# My Programming Profile

My name is William Uemura. I'm a high schooler with an intense love for programming who builds projects all the time. Below is an accessible list of most of the projects that I've worked on.

The idea for this profile page was basically ripped off from [this site](https://pfg.pw).


## My projects:

### [PassPal](https://passpal.williamuemura.repl.co/)

A very rudementary password generator and the first real website I've ever developed.


### [PassPal 2](https://passpal2.williamuemura.repl.co/)

A much prettier version of PassPal that will eventually replace PassPal altogether. 


### [My Replit Django Template](https://django.williamuemura.repl.co/)

An extension of the Django framework template offered by [Replit](https://replit.com) that includes a convenient location for css/js files and a prebuilt implementation of Django's page style inheritance.
