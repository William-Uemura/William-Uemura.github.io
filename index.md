# Welcome to my page.

### I'm a software developer. That means that I develop software, I'm pretty sure. More is going to be added to this site over time.


## My projects:

### [PassPal](https://passpal.williamuemura.repl.co/)

PassPal is the first website I've ever developed, and it allows you to generate a password with additional features letting you either add a choice amount of numbers to the end of your password or even turn your password into an Among Us reference. I need to go outside more.


### [PassPal 2](https://passpal2.williamuemura.repl.co/)

PassPal 2 is my second attempt at creating a password generator. This time, the website is much more beautiful, although many features from the first website have yet to be added to the second version. I plan on adding many more features to this site over time.


### [My Replit Django Template](https://django.williamuemura.repl.co/)

Plenty of web developers use Python every day to configure the backend to their websites. Django is a very convenient framework which can integrate Python code with webpages almost seamlessly. However, since most of my programs are ran over the online coding platform [Replit](https://replit.com), you have to set up your Django template somewhat differently.

Although Replit already offers a template for Django sites which is compatible with their platform, this template only gives you a single HTML page to work with. I very simply messed around in the settings for an hour to create a Django template on Replit which includes stylesheets and scripts along with page style inheritance already included.
